- Pull the latest job adverts from a specific website
- we need request libraray installed
- we will use .get from reuests to get info from the site
- we will use an empty string until we have the url
- go to the timesjobs.com and search for python jobs
- then copy and paste that url to scrape against, and we will only want the most upto date jobs posted 'a few days ago'
- if we use the url and print it - all the html
- again we want an instance of beautiful we can call it soup again, taking in html_text and the lxml library for parsing
- in a variable called jobs we want to find_all of the job listings on the page (soup)
- filter on location
- for each job in the list i want to find the location, and if that location is 'London' then find the salary and print a list of those job locations and salaries
- use an f string to make it pretty
